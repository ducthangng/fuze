## Fuze LAN toolkit
---

### Options
Fuze is built to be used cross-platform when connecting to the same LAN network. Currently only the similar source IP react to the call from Fuze Client. There are 2 options:
1. Sending file to many users at a time.
2. Communication via chat room.

There are no limits on the number of connection to the server, though depend on the LAN connection. 
I focus on building the underline mechanism, therefore interface will be quite crappy.

### Installation:
Require: Go 1.15
```
go get github.com/ducthangng/fuze
```

```
make
```
